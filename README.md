# please_kendrick_lamar

python script which checks whether Kendrick Lamar has released a new song in the last 24 hours and send you a text message with the result

NB: Make sure to fill in your own phone number on line 28.

##Scheduling the Python script to run at a prescribed time every day:

**Step 1:** On Windows, seach for "Task Manager' and open it. For Linux/Mac, I'm not too sure so look up a Youtube tutorial on how to set an automatic task.

**Step 2:** Double click on 'create basic task'.

**Step 3:** Complete the options on the wizard. These options include when you want the scheduled task to run, the path to the script you want to run, and any arguments to the script.
